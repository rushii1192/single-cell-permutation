# Single Cell Permutation

Recent advances in single-cell technologies provide valuable insights into the functions of the body's 37 trillion cells at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. To develop medicines, understanding the impact of chemical perturbations on cell states is crucial but challenging. Data science could accelerate this process by predicting perturbations accurately in different cell types.
